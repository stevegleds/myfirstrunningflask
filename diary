First time I've looked at this for nearly a year. Just getting to know my way around again.
Removed beautiful soup and urllib2 from requirements and now fails on heroku (failed before due to not being able to install beautiful soup)
5 November 2016
Add beautiful soup file for testing for dates of birth

10 October 2016
Used df.sort_values(...) to sort data file
Added simple input to sort by user input choice and passed parameter (choice) and is_ascending.
Need to find a way to stop re-running the csv parsing.

09 October 2016
added parsedates and now recognises dates and stores in yyyy-mm-dd format
next step see if can sort

08 October 2016
Created timetrialpandas to try out pandas for csv trying to sort date types such as float and date.
Seems to be OK. Works with floats but dates are strings

01 October 2016
Continued with Plumdog's flask-table but struggled.
Went back to Flask jinja template and used if/else statement to format based on name
Next step: get date in right format in python file . i.e. float, integer date.

29 September 2016
Added classes to table definition and then to <tr>
Next step: sorting

24 September 2016
Installed flask_table to see if it helps with displaying results in tables.
Added test in workingfile.py that creates table of results in terminal.
Next step : create working template so that I can use html to present to web page
Done. Created tables.html template and it looks good.
Next step : formatting with css

22 September 2016
Added sort ability to table. Static so far. Can't seem to find a way to make it sortable.
Seems I need to use the views before calling the template

12 September 2016
fixed css by moving 'static' folder under app folder!
08 September 2016
various tests for css using static folder and <link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}"> in <head> tag
No joy

07 September 2016
Fixed problem wit timetrial page : needed to specify python 3 on heroku
Created style.css in static folder need to apply it

30 August 2016
Used os.path.join to fix bad path to timetrial file when uploaded to server
Looking good but now getting no page even when all code commented out
Next step, create new template and add to it

28 August 2016
Successfully imported timetrial module into views.py and passed data to timetrial page.

24 August 2016
Managed to pass a parameter. Now need to link to timetrial code
23 August 2016
Added timetrial folder
Created timetrial template
Works but can't pass data!

16 August 2016
Getting nowhere. Trying to to use db but getting errors.
Need to think again
